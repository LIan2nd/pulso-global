    npm install
    ```

4.  **Set up environment variables:**
    * Create a new file named `.env` in the root of your project directory.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Assumptions & Limitations

* **NewsAPI.org Dependency:** The application is entirely dependent on the NewsAPI.org service. The free "Developer" plan has limitations, such as not being usable for commercial projects and having a cap on daily requests.
* **Front-End Only:** This is a front-end application. There is no backend server or database.
* **Mock Authentication:** The user authentication system is for demonstration purposes only. It uses `localStorage` to persist user sessions, which is **not secure** and should not be used in a production environment.
* **Search Limitations:** The search functionality is limited by the capabilities and query parameters provided by the NewsAPI.org service.
